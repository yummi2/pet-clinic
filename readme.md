# Red Hat Actions - Spring Pet Clinic Sample

[![OpenShift Pet Clinic Workflow](https://github.com/redhat-actions/spring-petclinic/workflows/OpenShift%20Pet%20Clinic%20Workflow/badge.svg)](https://github.com/redhat-actions/spring-petclinic/actions)

This is a fork of the [Spring Pet Clinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) which uses Red Hat's GitHub Actions to build an application image and deploy it to OpenShift as an example CI/CD workflow.

A Dockerfile and Helm Chart have been added to make this a cloud-ready version of the petclinic.

[This workflow](./.github/workflows/petclinic-sample.yml) uses the following Red Hat Actions:

- [buildah-action](https://github.com/redhat-actions/buildah-action)
- [push-to-registry](https://github.com/redhat-actions/push-to-registry)
- [oc-login](https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login)

It demos an end-to-end workflow which:
- Compiles a Java Spring web application
- Builds a container image
    - This action builds the image from scratch, but the [buildah-action](https://github.com/redhat-actions/buildah-action) also supports Dockerfile builds.
    - An action for performing [source-to-image builds](https://github.com/redhat-actions/s2i-build) is also available.
- Pushes that image to a registry
- Logs in to an OpenShift cluster
- Creates a Deployment, Service and Route to start a container and expose it to the internet
- Checks that the app is running successfully
- Tears down the test resources

This workflow runs on GitHub's Ubuntu runners, which come with `oc` 4.6.0 pre-installed.

If you're not using the Ubuntu runners, use [oc-installer](https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-installer) to install oc.

## Try it yourself

To run the workflow on your fork, you have to replace a few environment variables and secrets with your own values.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Enable actions on your fork by navigating to the Actions tab and allowing actions to run.
3. Replace the environment variable values in the workflow yaml with your own.
    - The environment variables you must edit are at the top of the workflow file.
    - Edit the `REGISTRY_USER` and `TEST_REGISTRY` to point to your container registry.
        - For example, if you want to push to Dockerhub as `john`:
            - Set `IMAGE_REGISTRY` to `docker.io`.
            - Set `REGISTRY_USER` to `john`.
            - The password is stored in a secret called `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` - see below.
    - Edit the `TEST_NAMESPACE` to the namespace you want the workflow to issue `oc` commands against. The namespace must exist before the workflow runs.
        - You can also remove the `TEST_NAMESPACE` and the workflow will use the default for your user.
4. [Add the necessary secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) in your forked repository's Settings.
    - Create a secret called `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` which contains the password, encrypted password, or token for the `REGISTRY_USER` you set up above.
    - See the [oc-login Getting Started](https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#getting-started-with-the-action-or-see-example) to determine the values for `OPENSHIFT_SERVER` and `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN`, and to read about the advantages and disadvantages of each authentication method.
        - The easiest way to retrieve these, if you're already logged in locally:
            - `oc whoami --show-server` for the `OPENSHIFT_SERVER`.
            - `oc whoami --show-token` for the `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN`.
5. Commit your changes and push to your fork.
6. The workflow will run to compile, build and deploy the petclinic.
7. To clean up the resources, log in locally, run `helm ls`, and delete the release that the workflow created.

    To have the workflow clean up after itself, set `TEAR_DOWN: true` in the `env` section at the top of the workflow.


### Docker Build

Separate from the demo above, the project can also be built from its Dockerfile with:
```
mvn package && docker build . -t petclinic:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 petclinic:latest
```

After the server starts, the app will be available at `localhost:8080`.
